### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m a supply chain analyst pivoting into ML engineering and research with supply chain applications. I'm currently working on finishing my master's degree in computer science, focused on artificial intelligence, data mining, database management, and data engineering. My background is in computer science, biochemistry, and supply chain management.

- ğŸŒ± In addition to working as an analyst, I'm taking two graduate courses in database management implementation and optimization of scalable data processing systems (primarily in PostgreSQL). 

- ğŸ’¬ Reach out if you want to collaborate on a project and need a data guy, or just want to talk about computers, math, or science!
